    Although we can’t change the mistakes of yesterday, we can learn from them and move forward into the day. We are in control of a part of ourselves that continues to learn, a part of ourselves that has the choice to make a decision to use what we have now to make the world a better place for everyone.

    Mission Life is a group that is held together by the talents, interests, strengths, and weaknesses of different individuals. The aim of the group is for these individuals to work together to work on a project or idea that involves helping people and/or the environment. 
    <br>
    Mission Life's first meetings will be held during Thursday lunchtimes in B7, to get to know everyone and to discuss projects that we would like to work on. Some meetings may move after school when we may need more time to work on projects.
